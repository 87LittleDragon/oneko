Neko is Japanese for cat. According to  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)) it was originally written for the NEC PC-9801.

There are many many versions. Generally it is considered Public Domain software, so I am placing my fork under the Unlicense.

This fork is based on [Werner Randelshofer's Java port](http://www.randelshofer.ch/blog/2010/07/screenmate-neko-in-java).

This initial commit contains Randelshofer's executable jar, containing the source. His description states:

> Feel free to copy the source code and images. You can change it if you like, for your own Neko Java program.

I include his jar for historical purposes, and it should not be covered by the Unlicense.
